            Oh no! You just ran out of milk! No need to worry. Just make a quick "run" (or walk) to the grocery store. Or, quickly get on your bike (lots of bicycles and motorcycles in the city) and ride there. Either way, you get excercise!
        </div>
        <div block="2">
            You just got a new job! Even better, all you have to do is take the metro there. No car needed. Take the metro to and back from work. It's that easy! And it's affordable.
        </div>
        <div block="3">
            In an urgent need of new clothes (for some reason)? Don't worry. There's a store for that just a few blocks away!
        </div>
        <div block="4">
            Need to make a trip to the bank ASAP? No need to worry! Have your local bank just a 7 minute walk away. You get to the bank, and you get excersice!
